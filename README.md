=========

Metakitty -- The Metasploit Resource Portal. This is a staging area to
actually get this stuff up and running without accidentally stomping all
over metasploit-framework.

Note that this repo will likely disappear for a more boringly-named
repo. But, for now, it's a staging area for development on
the Metasploit Resource portal:

https://metasploit.github.io

(also will not use that URL as a main)

## Adding Content

The public repo for contributor content is over at

https://github.com/metasploit/resource-portal-data

which is submoduled here as `resource-portal-data`.

If you would like to add an entirely new category, that's fine, but be
sure to update `source/index.html.erb` with the name, and note that the
filename must match the symbol in the current regime.
