=========

Metakitty -- The Metasploit Resource Portal. This is a staging area to
actually get this stuff up and running without accidentally stomping all
over metasploit-framework.

This repo will not disappear as previously threatened. We'll keep the
staging area private for now, and publish to:

http://resources.metasploit.com


## Adding Content

The public repo for contributor content is over at

https://github.com/metasploit/resource-portal-data

which is submoduled here as `resource-portal-data`.

If you would like to add an entirely new category, that's fine, but be
sure to update `source/index.html.erb` with the name, and note that the
filename must match the symbol in the current regime.
