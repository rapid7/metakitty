metakitty
=========

Metakitty -- The Metasploit Resource Portal. This is a staging area to
actually get this stuff up and running without accidentally stomping all
over metasploit-framework.

Note that this repo will likely disappear for a more boringly-named
repo. But, for now, it's a staging area for development on
the Metasploit Resource portal:

https://metasploit.github.io

(also will not use that URL as a main)

## Adding Content

Eventually, the public repo will be the place for content adds, and it
will use the usual pull request method. For now, feel free to fork
and edit in the `data/` directory. If you add an entirely new category,
be sure to update `source/index.html.erb` with the name, and note that
the filename must match the symbol in the current regime.
